# Klein-Gordon Equation in Curved Spacetime

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive exploration of the Klein-Gordon equation in the context of curved spacetime, integrating concepts from quantum gravity and quantum field theory. It includes various simulations using Qiskit to model scalar field behavior under the influence of spacetime curvature.
